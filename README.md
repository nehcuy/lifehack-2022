A Hackathon Project from LifeHack 2022. Access our WebApp&nbsp;`Lockdown`&nbsp;[here](https://lifehack2022-lockdown.vercel.app/).

## **Problem Statement**

Safety:&nbsp;

How can we ensure the safety of our personal property (money/e-banking, data, personal belongings, assets, residences, community spaces etc.)?

## **Rationale**

Drawing inspiration from existing applications that already provide alert messages for mobile phone movement, we decided to take it a step further.&nbsp;

By connecting a mobile phone to a tablet, we can now keep our tablets (which contain lots of personal information) safe from theft.&nbsp;

Once in lockdown mode, any movements detected by the tablet will send an alert to the mobile user that is connected to the tablet through a 4 digit code.

## **Process**

Upon entering the startup screen, choose the device you are on (either a tablet or a mobile phone). Depending on which option you select, you will be brought to two pages:

1.  [Phone](#phone)
2.  [Tablet](#tablet)

### **<ins>Phone</ins>**

Enter the 4 digit code that is shown on the tablet and click&nbsp;`SUBMIT`. You will then enter the [Lockdown Page](#lockdown-page).

### **<ins>Tablet</ins>**

The 4 digit code shown on the screen is to be entered onto your mobile phone and the tablet is now connected to your phone.

## **Lockdown Page**

This will be the main page where a SINGLE BUTTON is all it takes to put your tablet device on "lockdown". After which, any external movements sensed by the built-in device gyroscope will send an alert to the mobile phone which was used to activate lockdown mode on the tablet. This movement will simulate possible events of:

*   Theft
*   Damage to the tablet&nbsp;

and you are able to stay informed, even if you are away from your tablet!
