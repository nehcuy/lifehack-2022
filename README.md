## Problem Statement

Safety: How can we ensure the safety of our personal property (money/e-banking, data, personal belongings, assets, residences, community spaces etc.)?

## Rationale

Drawing inspiration from existing applications that already provide alert messages for mobile phone movement, we decided to take it a step further. By connecting a mobile phone to a tablet, we can now keep our tablets (which contain lots of personal information) safe from theft. Once in lockdown mode, any movements detected by the tablet will send an alert to the mobile user that is connected to the tablet through a 4 digit code.

## Process

Upon entering the startup screen, choose the device you are on (either a tablet or a mobile phone). Depending on which option you select, you will be brought to two pages:
- [Phone](#phone)
- [Tablet](#tablet)

### Phone

Enter the 4 digit code that is shown on the tablet and click `SUBMIT`. You will then enter the [LockDown Page](#lockdown-page).

### Tablet

The 4 digit code shown on the screen is to be entered onto your mobile phone and the tablet is now connected to your phone.

## LockDown Page

This will be the main page where a SINGLE BUTTON is all it takes to put your tablet device on "lockdown". After which, any external movements sensed by the built-in device gyroscope will send an alert to the mobile phone which was used to activate lockdown mode on the tablet. This movement will simulate possible events of:
- Theft
- Damage to the tablet
and you are able to stay informed, even if you are away from your tablet!
